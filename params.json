  "body": "# Panning-Zooming-Canvas-Demos\r\n\r\nA series of demos that shows how to display an image on a html5 canvas, pan around, zoom in and out\r\n\r\n### Demo 1\r\nIntroduction to HTML5 canvas. How to initialize a canvas object and draw a colored rectangle.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 1](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo1)\r\n\r\n### Demo 2\r\nHow to intialize an image object and draw it inside of the canvas\r\n\r\n[View Demo 3](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo2)\r\n\r\n### Demo 3\r\nHow to calculate the scaling of an image given a predefined width and draw it to the canvas\r\n\r\n[View Demo 3](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo3)\r\n\r\n### Demo 4\r\nInitialize a bunch of canvas events: clicking (mousedown), dragging (mousemove), letting go (mouseup) and write a simple log of the events.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 4](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo4)\r\n\r\n### Demo 5\r\nGrab the coordinates of mousedown, initialize the drag event and update the distanced moved from dragging. Update the canvas image based on distanced moved/dragged.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 5](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo5)\r\n\r\n### Demo 6\r\nKeep track of how far the image moved based on previous drag events instead of resetting the image position to 0,0 every time.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 6](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo6)\r\n\r\n### Demo 7\r\nIncorporate jQuery to quickly handle/access button events for new Zoom in and Zoom out options. Use a basic 2x zoom scale and multiply the size by 2 when zooming in. Divide by 2 when zooming out. Redraw the canvas with new sizes for each zoomin/zoomout event.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 7](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo7)\r\n\r\n### Demo 8\r\nAll zoom in/zoom out events were initially being draw to 0,0 for the upper left coordinate. Zoom in/out to the center of image instead of the top left. \r\n\r\n[View Demo 8](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo8)\r\n\r\n### Demo 9\r\nSince we're calculating the center frequently, create a method that can be used throughout instead of calculating it every event. Also set the initial image display to be centered.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 9](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo9)\r\n\r\n### Demo 10\r\nDetect pinch gesture insanely easily. Draw the points to the canvas. Must be on mobile device.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 10](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo10)\r\n\r\n### Demo 11\r\nDetect pinch gesture and calculate a ratio based on how much we've moved then scale an image up/down.\r\n\r\n[View Demo 11](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo11)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Demo 12\r\nZoom in and out on mouse wheel point (with default panning functionality)\r\n\r\n[View Demo 12](http://dayobject.me/canvas/demo12)\r\n\r\n",
